## Project Goal

In simple terms, my goal is to show my skills in using HTML and CSS to create a website that looks great on any device. The website will be a sweet and delightful place that reflects the passion of a grandmother for chocolates.

## User Experience (UX) Development

As a New user I want to explore the website effortlessly and quickly find information about the grandmother's delightful chocolates and treats.

## Design choices

### Typography

- #### Headings: 
The font type chosen was: font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive, sans-serif;
  
![Font headings](docs/font01.png)


- #### Body: 
The font type selected was: font-family: 'Barlow Condensed', sans-serif;
  

![Font body](docs/font02.png)


Both styles through https://fonts.google.com


I made sure the fonts on the website go together well by using the website https://www.fontpair.co/all. This tool helped me choose fonts that work nicely together, making the site look better.


### Colour Scheme

The website, centered around the theme of a chocolate-loving grandmother. The colors #8d4925 and rgba(237, 222, 207) and color white were chosen to resonate with the essence of content.

I choose the rgba(237, 222, 207) color scheme, adjusting the opacity in the range of 0.5 to 1 to achieve the most suitable visual outcome.
These colors work together to bring our website to life, reminding users of the joy of sharing delicious chocolates and the warmth of family connections.

### Imagery 

All the pictures were picked to match the theme of the website. The images were chosen from free image using the website https://www.pexels.com .


### Site layout
  
The website layout features a header with the logo and navigation menu. It comprises three sections: "Our Product," "About Us," and "Contact Us." Additionally, there's a page to express gratitude for visiting the site and for signing up. Furthermore, the website includes a footer containing links to our social media profiles, allowing easy connection and interaction.


### Wireframe

The wireframe was made using a tool called Balsamiq. This tool helped create an early look at the website before actually building it. This made it easier to organize how things would look and where pictures and content would go. It also helped make sure everything looks nice on different devices like phones and computers.
